Follow the examples and respond to the question in a similar manner. You can do all the reasoning you want, but your last sentence has to begin with 'The answer is '.

Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: The variables in the task are:
x = 15 - the number of trees in the grove
y = 21 - the number of trees in the grove after planting
The goal is to find:
z = ? - the number of trees the grove workers planted today
Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer.
y - x = 21 - 15 = 6 - the number of trees the grove workers planted today
The answer is 6

Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
A: The variables in the task are:
x = 3 - the number of cars in the parking lot
y = 2 - the number of cars that arrived
The goal is to find:
z = ? - the number of cars in the parking lot after the cars arrived
Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer.
x + y = 3 + 2 = 5 - the number of cars in the parking lot after the cars arrived
The answer is 5

Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: The variables in the task are:
x = 23 - the amount of money Olivia has
y = 5 - the number of bagels she bought
z = 3 - the price of one bagel
The goal is to find:
r = ? - the amount of money Olivia has left
Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer.
y * z = 5 * 3 = 15 - the amount of money Olivia spent on bagels
x - y * z = 23 - 15 = 8 - the amount of money Olivia has left
The answer is 8
