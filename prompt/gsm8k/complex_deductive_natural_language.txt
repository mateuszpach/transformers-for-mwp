Q: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?
A: Let's think deductively
If Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, then he scores 50 points in 2 pointers.
If Mark's team scores 8 3 pointers, then he scores 24 points in 3 pointers.
If Mark's team scores 10 free throws, then he scores 10 points in free throws.
If Mark's opponents score double the 2 pointers than Mark's team which scores 50 points in 2 pointers, then they score 100 points in 2 pointers.
If Mark's opponents score half the 3 pointers than Mark's team which scores 24 points in 3 pointers, then they score 12 points in 3 pointers.
If Mark's opponents score half the free throws than Mark's team which scores 10 points in free throws, then they score 5 points in free throws.
If Mark's team scores 50 points in 2 pointers, 24 points in 3 pointers and 10 points in free throws, then they score 84 points in total.
If Mark's opponents score 100 points in 2 pointers, 12 points in 3 pointers and 5 points in free throws, then they score 117 points in total.
If Mark's team scores 84 points in total and Mark's opponents score 117 points in total, then both teams score 201 points in total.
The answer is 201

Q: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?
A: Let's think deductively
If Bella has 60 marbles and two times as many marbles as frisbees, then she has 30 frisbees.
If Bella has 30 frisbees and 20 more frisbees than deck cards, then she has 10 deck cards.
If Bella has 60 marbles, 30 frisbees and 10 deck cards, then she has 100 items in total.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more of each item and now she has 100 items, then she buys 40 items in total.
If Bella has 100 items in total and buys 40 items in total, then she has 140 items in total.
The answer is 140


Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
A: Let's think deductively
If there are 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets, then there are 38 fruits in each of the first three baskets.
If there are 38 fruits in each of the first three baskets, then there are 114 fruits in the first three baskets.
If there are 9 apples and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket, then there are 7 apples in the fourth basket.
If there are 15 oranges and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket, then there are 13 oranges in the fourth basket.
If there are 14 bananas and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket, then there are 12 bananas in the fourth basket.
If there are 7 apples, 13 oranges, and 12 bananas in the fourth basket, then there are 32 fruits in the fourth basket.
If there are 114 fruits in the first three baskets and 32 fruits in the fourth basket, then there are 146 fruits in total.
The answer is 146
