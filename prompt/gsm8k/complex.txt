Q: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?
A: Let's think step by step
Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.
All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.
His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.
They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.
All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
The answer is 201

Q: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?
A: Let's think step by step
When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
The answer is 140

Question: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?
A: Let's think step by step
For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24
In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three baskets.
Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.
The number of apples in the fourth basket is 9-2=7
There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket
The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20
The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas.
In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits.
The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.
The answer is 146
