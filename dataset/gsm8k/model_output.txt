The answer is 163. To find out, we can start by subtracting the number of post-it notes Candice used at work from the total number of post-it notes she had before work: 80 - 220 = -140. This means she used 140 more post-it notes than she had. To figure out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we can add the number of post-it notes she had left over to the number she used at work: 23 + 220 = 243. Then, we can subtract the number of post-it notes she started with: 243 - 80 = 163. Therefore, there were 163 post-it notes in the package she purchased.
