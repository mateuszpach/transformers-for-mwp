Let's think deductively If Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day and she eats three for breakfast every morning, then she has 13 eggs left. If Janet has 13 eggs left and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four, then she has 9 eggs left to sell. If Janet sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg, then she makes 18 dollars every day. The answer is 18 dollars.
Let's think deductively If a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, then it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. If a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber, then it takes 3 bolts in total. The answer is 3 bolts.
Let's think deductively If Josh buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs, then he has invested $130,000 in total. If the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, then the new value of the house is 250% of the original value. If the original value of the house was $80,000, then the new value of the house is $200,000. If Josh invested $130,000 and the new value of the house is $200,000, then his profit is $70,000. The answer is $70,000.

Let's think deductively If Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 3 cups of feed in each meal, then she gives them 9 cups of feed in total per day. If Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, then she gives them 40 cups of feed in total for the first two meals of the day. If Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 9 cups of feed in total per day and she has already given them 40 cups of feed in the first two meals of the day, then she needs to give them 11 cups of feed in the final meal of the day to reach a total of 60 cups of feed for the day. The answer is 11.
Let's think deductively If one glass costs $5, then every second glass costs $3 (60% of $5). If Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, then he needs to buy 8 glasses at full price and 8 glasses at the discounted price. If he buys 8 glasses at full price, then he pays $5 x 8 = $40. If he buys 8 glasses at the discounted price, then he pays $3 x 8 = $24. If he pays $40 for 8 glasses and $24 for 8 glasses, then he needs to pay $64 in total. The answer is $64.

If Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, then Toulouse has 160 sheep. If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 80 sheep, and Toulouse has 160 sheep, then they have 260 sheep in total. The answer is 260.
Let's think deductively If Carla can download 2 GB/minute, then it would take her 100 minutes to download a 200 GB file. If Carla is 40% of the way through the download when Windows forces a restart, then she has downloaded 80 GB of the file. If Windows forces a restart and it takes 20 minutes to install updates, then Carla loses 40 GB of the download progress. If Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, then she has to download the full 200 GB file again. If Carla has to download the full 200 GB file again, then it would take her 100 minutes to download it. If Carla lost 40 GB of the download progress and has to download the full 200 GB file again, then it would take her a total of 140 minutes to download the file. The answer is 140 minutes.
Let's think deductively If John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then he covers a distance of 180 miles. If John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, then he doesn't cover any distance. If John drives for the next half-hour at a speed of 30 mph, then he covers a distance of 15 miles. If John drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph, then he covers a distance of 120 miles. If John covers a distance of 180 miles in the first 3 hours, 15 miles in the next half-hour, and 120 miles in the remaining 1.5 hours, then he covers a total distance of 315 miles. If John is trying to get home, then he is 315 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours. The answer is 315 miles.
Let's think deductively If Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10, then she earns $400 for the first 40 hours. If Eliza receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, then her overtime rate is $12 per hour. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, then she worked 5 hours of overtime. If Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime at a rate of $12 per hour, then she earned an additional $60 in overtime pay. If Eliza earned $400 for the first 40 hours and an additional $60 in overtime pay, then her total earnings for this week are $460. The answer is $460.
Let's think deductively If the program had 60 downloads in the first month, and the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, then there were 180 downloads in the second month. If there were 180 downloads in the second month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month, then there were 126 downloads in the third month. If there were 60 downloads in the first month, 180 downloads in the second month, and 126 downloads in the third month, then there were 366 downloads in total over the three months. The answer is 366.

If Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, then she spent $160 on mini cupcakes. If Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen, then she spent $330 on mini cheesecakes. If Toula spent $204 on donuts, $160 on mini cupcakes, and $330 on mini cheesecakes, then she spent $694 in total. The answer is $694.
Let's think deductively If Carlos sells 7 lemons for $1.5 each, then he earns $10.5 per year. If it costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree, then Carlos earns $7.5 per year from the lemon tree. If the tree costs $90 to plant and Carlos earns $7.5 per year, then it will take him 12 years to earn back the initial cost of the tree. If Carlos earns back the initial cost of the tree in 12 years and starts earning money after that, then he will start earning money on the lemon tree in the 13th year. The answer is 13 years.
Let's think deductively If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left and half of what was left after selling to the red house was sold at the orange house, then she had 10 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house. If Melanie sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house and a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, then she sold 3 vacuum cleaners at the green house and 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house, leaving her with 10 vacuum cleaners. If Melanie had 10 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house and 3 vacuum cleaners at the green house, then she started with 13 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 13.

Let's think deductively If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, then the value of the jewelry will increase by $125. If the electronic gadgets market goes up 1.2%, then the value of the electronic gadgets will increase by $96. If the merchant chooses to purchase the jewelry worth $5,000 and the value increases by $125, then the new value of the jewelry will be $5,125. If the merchant chooses to purchase the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 and the value increases by $96, then the new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,096. If the merchant wants to maximize profit, then he should choose to purchase the electronic gadgets worth $8,000. If the value of the electronic gadgets increases by $96 and the merchant sells it for the new value of $8,096, then the profit will be $1,096. The answer is $1,096.

If the two trains cover 80 miles each in the first day and travel northwards for 150 miles the next day, then each train covers 150 miles in the second day. If each train covers 80 miles in the first day and 150 miles in the second day, then each train covers 230 miles in total. The answer is 230 miles for each train.
Let's think deductively If Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher and gets paid $20 per hour, then she earns $700 per week as a teacher. If Jill works 15 hours a week as a coach and gets paid $30 per hour, then she earns $450 per week as a coach. If Jill earns $700 per week as a teacher and $450 per week as a coach, then she earns $1150 per week in total. If Jill works 50 weeks a year and earns $1150 per week, then she earns $57,500 per year in total. The answer is $57,500.
Let's think deductively If Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, then she uses 21 eggs in a week (3 eggs x 7 days). If Claire uses 21 eggs in a week, then she uses 84 eggs in 4 weeks (21 eggs x 4 weeks). If Claire uses 84 eggs in 4 weeks, then she uses 7 dozens of eggs (84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen). The answer is 7 dozens of eggs.
Let's think deductively If Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour, then her speed was 4 miles per hour. If Marissa walked 2 more miles in another hour, then her total distance covered is 6 miles and her total time taken is 2 hours. If Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, then she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours. If Marissa needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours, then her speed needs to be 4 miles per hour. If Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, then the answer is 4 miles per hour. The answer is 4 miles per hour.
Let's think deductively If 10 liters of orange drink are two-thirds water, then there are 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink. If 15 liters of pineapple drink are three-fifths water, then there are 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink. If 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, then there are only 9 liters of orange drink left to mix with the pineapple drink. If there are 9 liters of orange drink left and 15 liters of pineapple drink, then there are 24 liters of drink in total. If the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water and the pineapple drink has 9 liters of water, then there are 15.67 liters of water in the 24 liters of drink. If 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled and there are 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink, then there are 23 liters of drink left. The answer is 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink.

If 75% of the original price is $19.50, then 1% of the original price is $19.50/75. If 1% of the original price is $19.50/75, then 100% of the original price is $19.50/75 x 100. If 100% of the original price is $26, then the original price of the book was $26. The answer is $26.
Let's think deductively If Marie ordered 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, then she spent $15 on milk. If Marie ordered 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, then she spent $6 on apples. If Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, then she spent $12 on the chicken meal. If Marie spent $15 on milk, $6 on apples, and $12 on the chicken meal, then she spent $33 in total on those items. If Marie paid a total of $50 and spent $33 on milk, apples, and the chicken meal, then she spent $17 on pizza. If each box of pizza costs $8.50 and Marie spent $17 on pizza, then she ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is 2.

Let's think deductively If Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, then she eats 30 servings of ice cream in 2 weeks. If she buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton, then she needs 2 cartons of ice cream every month. If each carton of ice cream costs $4.00, then she spends $8.00 every month on ice cream. If she spends $8.00 every month on ice cream, then she spends $24.00 in 3 months. If she spends $24.00 in 3 months, then she spends $48.00 in 6 months. If she spends $48.00 in 6 months, then she spends $96.00 in a year. If she spends $96.00 in a year, then she spends $48.00 in 6 months. If she spends $48.00 in 6 months, then she spends $8.00 in a month. If she spends $8.00 in a month, then she spends $4.00 in 2 weeks. If she spends $4.00 in 2 weeks, then she spends $2.00 in a week. If she spends $2.00 in a week, then she spends $60.00 in 60 days. The answer is $60.00.
Let's think deductively If Henry's bike trip is 60 miles and he first stopped after 20 miles, then he traveled 40 miles after his first stop. If Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, then he traveled 45 miles before his second stop. If Henry traveled 40 miles after his first stop and 45 miles before his second stop, then he traveled 85 miles between his first and second stops. The answer is 85 miles.
Let's think deductively If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, then the other pair of heels costs $66. If the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots, then the boots cost $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. If the two pairs of high heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99, then the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104. The answer is $104.
Let's think deductively If Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, then we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively. If their total age now is 162, then 7x + 11x = 162. Simplifying the equation, we get 18x = 162. Therefore, x = 9. If Allen's age now is 11x = 11*9 = 99, then his age 10 years from now will be 99 + 10 = 109. The answer is 109.
Let's think deductively If one friend says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, then the second friend says there are 20 more than half of 80, which is 60 jelly beans. If one friend says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar, then the third friend says there are 25% more than 80, which is 100 jelly beans. If the three friends guessed 80, 60, and 100 jelly beans, then their total guess is 240 jelly beans. If their total guess is 240 jelly beans and there are three friends, then their average guess is 80 jelly beans. The answer is 80.
Let's think deductively If John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business, then he spends 5 hours a day taking care of dogs. If John spends 5 hours a day taking care of dogs, then he spends 35 hours a week taking care of dogs. The answer is 35 hours.
Let's think deductively If Gretchen has 110 coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then let's assume she has x silver coins. If there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has x+30 gold coins. If Gretchen has x silver coins and x+30 gold coins, then she has a total of x+x+30 = 2x+30 coins. If Gretchen has 110 coins in total, then 2x+30 = 110. If we solve for x, we get x = 40. If Gretchen has 40 silver coins, then she has 40+30 = 70 gold coins. The answer is 70 gold coins.
Let's think deductively If Raymond has 40 jewels, then half of his jewels is 20 jewels. If Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, then Aaron has 25 jewels. If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, then Siobhan has 23 jewels. The answer is 23.
Let's think deductively If Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes, then he scores 5 points in the second 20 minutes (25% more than 4). If Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 5 points in the second 20 minutes, then he scores 9 points in total in the second 20 minutes. If Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 9 points in the second 20 minutes, then he scores 13 points in total. The answer is 13 points.
Let's think deductively If Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, then he eats 60 yogurts in 30 days. If the yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, then each yogurt costs $1.25.

Let's think deductively If John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, then he earns $195 in total. If John buys 8 video games for $20 each, then he spends $160 in total. If John has $5 left after buying the video games, then he had $195 - $160 + $5 = $40 before buying the video games. If John earned $195 from selling 13 lego sets, then each lego set was sold for $15. If John had $40 before buying the video games and each lego set was sold for $15, then he had 2 lego sets left. The answer is 2.
Let's think deductively If John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, then he runs 20 miles each day. If John runs 3 hours the first day, then he runs at a speed of 6.67 miles per hour (20 miles / 3 hours). If John runs half as much the other two days he runs, then he runs 1.5 hours each of those days. If John runs 1.5 hours each of the other two days, then he runs at a speed of 13.33 miles per hour (20 miles / 1.5 hours). Since John runs at different speeds on different days, we cannot determine his overall speed. The answer cannot be determined.
Let's think deductively If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and that's half as fast as she can run, then she can run at 6 miles per hour. If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, then she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking. If Dana can run at 6 miles per hour for 2 hours, then she can travel 12 miles while running. If Dana can walk at 1.5 miles per hour (since she runs at 4 times the speed of walking) for 4 hours, then she can travel 6 miles while walking. If Dana can travel 12 miles while running and 6 miles while walking, then she can travel 18 miles in total. The answer is 18 miles.
Let's think deductively If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. If Ben's iPhone is 2 years old and Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, then Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is 8 years old.

If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have 200 calories left for the day. If a bag of chips has 1250 calories in total and you have 200 calories left for the day, then you can eat 60 grams of chips. The answer is 60 grams.
Let's think deductively If for every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles, then he can make 200 candles with 20 pounds of beeswax. If one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies, then 20 pounds of beeswax and wicks cost $200.00 in supplies. If Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 each, then he earns $400.00 by selling 200 candles. If Charlie earns $400.00 by selling 200 candles and spent $200.00 on supplies, then his net profit is $200.00. The answer is $200.00.
Let's think deductively If Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, then she spent 20 hours writing on Monday. If Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, then she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. If Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, then she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. If each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, then Meredith spent 7 * 4 = 28 hours writing on Tuesday. If Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday on Wednesday, then she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. If each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, then Meredith spent 14 * 4 = 56 hours writing on Wednesday. If Meredith spent 20 hours writing on Monday, 28 hours writing on Tuesday, and 56 hours writing on Wednesday, then she spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours writing in the three days. The answer is 104.
Let's think deductively If Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse and had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, then she used 57 post-it notes at work. If she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, then she used 220 post-it notes at work. If she used 57 post-it notes overall and 220 post-it notes at work, then she used 277 post-it notes in total. If she purchased a package of post-it notes and used 277 post-it notes in total, then the number of post-it notes in the package is the difference between 277 and 80, which is 197. The answer is 197.
Let's think deductively If John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, then he bought 5 blue ties. If John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, then he bought 10 red ties. If the blue ties cost $40 each, then John spent $200 on blue ties. If the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, then they cost $60 each. If John bought 10 red ties that cost $60 each, then he spent $600 on red ties. If John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties, then he spent $800 on ties in total. The answer is $800.
Let's think deductively If the wire is 4 feet long, then it is 48 inches long. If the wire is cut into pieces 6 inches long, then Tracy obtains 8 pieces for every foot of wire. If the wire is 48 inches long, then Tracy obtains 8 pieces for every foot of wire, which means she obtains 8 x 4 = 32 pieces in total. The answer is 32.
Let's think deductively If each floor contains 8 units and there are 15 floors, then there are 120 units in total in the building. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. If 1/4 of the building is unoccupied and there are 120 units in total, then there are 30 unoccupied units in the building. The answer is 30.
Let's think deductively If Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, then they produce 1764 eggs per week. If Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, then he sells them for $0.1667 per egg. If Lloyd sells 1764 eggs per week for $0.1667 per egg, then he makes $294.99 per week on eggs. The answer is $294.99.
Let's think deductively If Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, then he travels 30 miles from 1 to 4 PM. If Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph, then it takes him 5 hours to travel back. The answer is 5 hours.
Let's think deductively If Uriah removes 30 comic books, then he removes 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds from his book bag. If Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag and he already removed 7.5 pounds by removing comic books, then he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds more. If Uriah's toys weigh 1/2 pound each and he needs to remove 7.5 pounds more, then he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys. The answer is 15.
Let's think deductively If the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and charges $60 for each tire, then he earns $360 for the truck tires. If the mechanic repairs 4 car tires and charges $40 for each tire, then he earns $160 for the car tires. If the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and charges $40 for each tire, then he earns $480 for the car tires. If the mechanic earns $360 for the truck tires and $160 for the car tires on Thursday, then he earns $520 in total on Thursday. If the mechanic earns $480 for the car tires on Friday and doesn't repair any truck tires, then he earns $480 in total on Friday. If the mechanic earns $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday, then he earns $40 more on Thursday. The answer is $40.

Let's think deductively If the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, then the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - the weight of the driver. If the weight of each box is 15 pounds and we want to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, then we need to divide the remaining weight limit (5000 - the weight of the empty truck) by the weight of each box. If the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - the weight of the driver, then we need to subtract this weight from the bridge's weight limit to get the remaining weight limit: 5000 - (3755 - the weight of the driver) = 1245 + the weight of the driver. If the weight of each box is 15 pounds and we want to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, then we need to divide the remaining weight limit (1245 + the weight of the driver) by the weight of each box: (1245 + the weight of the driver) / 15. The answer is (1245 + the weight of the driver) / 15.
Let's think deductively If Stephen's final bill came to $40.00, then the cost of the groceries before fees was $40.00 - $3.00 - $4.00 = $33.00. If the delivery vendor tacked on a 25% fee to his final total, then the fee was $33.00 * 0.25 = $8.25. If Stephen added a $4.00 tip, then the total extra fees were $8.25 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $15.25. If the cost of the groceries before fees was $33.00 and the total extra fees were $15.25, then the final price of Stephen's groceries was $33.00 + $15.25 = $48.25. The answer is $48.25.
Let's think deductively If there are 6 clusters of 20 fruit each, then there are 120 raspberries in the clusters.

Let's think deductively If there are 25 oranges in the basket and 1 is bad, then there are 24 good oranges. If 20% of the oranges are unripe, then 20% of 25 is 5, so there are 5 unripe oranges. If 2 oranges are sour, then there are 2 sour oranges. If there are 24 good oranges, 5 unripe oranges, and 2 sour oranges, then there are 31 total oranges that are not bad. If there are 31 total oranges that are not bad, and 1 is bad, then there are 30 good oranges. The answer is 30.
Let's think deductively If Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch and $800 for the jeweler to construct it, then she pays $1300 in total. If Janet pays 10% of $1300 to get the brooch insured, then she pays $130 for insurance. If Janet pays $1300 for the brooch and $130 for insurance, then she pays $1430 in total. The answer is $1430.
Let's think deductively If Marcy works for the same company for 30 years, then she is entitled to 30/40 or 3/4 of the annual pension. If the annual pension is $50,000, then Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is (3/4) * $50,000 = $37,500. If Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years, then after 10 years (from year 20 to year 30), she is entitled to an additional 10 * 5% = 50% of the value of the pension. If the value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000, then the additional amount Marcy is entitled to after 10 years is 50% * $50,000 = $25,000. If Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is $37,500 and she is entitled to an additional $25,000, then her annual pension after 30 years is $37,500 + $25,000 = $62,500. The answer is $62,500.
Let's think deductively If Aleena is charged $140 per month, then she is charged $840 for the first six months of the year. If Aleena is charged 10% less money on the other half of the year, then she is charged $126 per month for the remaining six months of the year. If Aleena is charged $126 per month for the remaining six months of the year, then she is charged $756 for the remaining six months of the year. If Aleena is charged $840 for the first six months of the year and $756 for the remaining six months of the year, then she is charged $1596 in total for the year. The answer is $1596.

Let's think deductively If Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, then she spent $750 in total. If a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, then the interest for each phone is $3 ($150 x 0.02). If Shiela spent $750 in total and the interest for each phone is $3, then the total interest is $15 ($3 x 5). If Shiela will pay for the phones and the interest in a 3-month installment, then she will pay $255 each month ($750 + $15 = $765, $765/3 = $255). The answer is $255.

Let's think deductively If the top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16, then the level below it has a square footage of 32. If the level below has a square footage of 32, then the level below that has a square footage of 64. If the level below that has a square footage of 64, then the level at the bottom has a square footage of 128. If the sandcastle has 4 levels and the bottom level has a square footage of 128, then the total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240. If the sandcastle has 4 levels, then the average square footage of a level is 240/4 = 60. The answer is 60.

If Cecilia has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, then she will use 2 cups of dog food every day after the first 180 days. If there are 365 days in a year and Cecilia has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the last 185 days of the year, then she will use 370 cups of dog food in the last 185 days of the year. If Cecilia uses 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days and 370 cups of dog food in the last 185 days of the year, then she will use 550 cups of dog food in the first year. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, then Cecilia will need 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is 5 bags.

Let's think deductively If the football team played 22 games, then they won some games and lost some games. If they won 8 more games than they lost, then we can represent the number of games they won as x and the number of games they lost as x-8. If they won x games and lost x-8 games, then they played a total of 22 games, so x + (x-8) = 22. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 8 = 22. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 2x = 30. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 15. Therefore, the football team won 15 games. The answer is 15.

If Sylvie has stayed in the company for five years, then her salary has been increased by 10% of her initial salary every year for the past five years. If Sylvie's salary has been increased by 10% of her initial salary every year for the past five years, then her current annual salary is $10,497.60. If Sylvie works for three more years, then her salary will be increased by 10% of her current salary every year for the next three years. If Sylvie's salary is increased by 10% of her current salary every year for the next three years, then her annual salary after three more years of service will be $14,506.38. The answer is $14,506.38.
Let's think deductively If Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, then Marilyn sold 10x and Harald sold x copies. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, then 10x + x = 11x = 88,000. If 11x = 88,000, then x = 8,000. If Harald sold x = 8,000 copies, then the answer is 8,000. The answer is 8,000.
