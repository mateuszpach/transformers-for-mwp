Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? Let's think step by step Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and she eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins with four, so she uses 3+4=7 eggs per day. The number of eggs remaining is 16-7=9 eggs per day. Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9*2=$18 per day. The answer is $18.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. Find the total number of bolts required.

Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%. What is the profit he made? Let's think step by step 150% increase in value means the value of the house increased by 1.5 times. So, the new value of the house is 1.5 * ($80,000 + $50,000) = $195,000 Josh's total cost for the house and repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 Therefore, his profit is $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000 The answer is $65,000.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. What is the total number of meters he runs in a week? Let's think step by step James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, so he runs 3*3=9 sprints in a week. Each sprint is 60 meters, so he runs 60*9=540 meters in a week. The answer is 540.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Wendi has 20 chickens. Each chicken needs 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per day, given in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives them 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day? Let's think step by step Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, so for 20 chickens, Wendi needs to provide 3*20=60 cups of feed per day. In the morning, she gives them 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed, so she has already given them 15+25=40 cups of feed. To meet the daily requirement of 60 cups of feed, she needs to give them an additional 60-40=20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is 20 cups.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. What is the total amount Kylar needs to pay for the glasses? Let's think step by step Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. If he buys them one by one, he'll pay $5 for the first glass, and $5 for the second glass, and so on. So he'll pay $5*16 = $80 in total. However, every second glass costs only 60% of the price. So Kylar can buy the glasses in pairs, and pay $5 for the first glass, and $5*0.6 = $3 for the second glass. So he'll pay $5+$3 = $8 for a pair of glasses. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he'll need to buy 8 pairs of glasses. So he'll pay $8*8 = $64 in total. The answer is $64.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Find the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. Let's think step by step Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, meaning Charleston has 4*20=80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning Toulouse has 2*80=160 sheep. Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20+80+160=260 sheep. The answer is 260.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute. 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. Carla then restarts the download from the beginning. How long does it take to download the file? Let's think step by step The total time it would take to download the file without any interruptions is 200/2 = 100 minutes. However, Carla is interrupted 40% of the way through, which means she has downloaded 0.4*200 = 80 GB of the file. The time it took her to download 80 GB is 80/2 = 40 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the full 200 GB. The time it would take her to download the full 200 GB is 200/2 = 100 minutes. However, she already spent 40 minutes downloading 80 GB before the restart, so the total time it takes her to download the full 200 GB is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes. The answer is 160.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, then drives at 30 mph for half an hour before driving the remaining time at 80 mph. What is the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours? Let's think step by step In the first 3 hours, John drives at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3*60=180 miles. When he turns around, he is 180 miles from home. In the next 2 hours, he is in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance. In the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 30/2=15 miles. In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 1.5*80=120 miles. The total distance he covers is 180+15+120=315 miles. Therefore, he is 315 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours. The answer is 315.

She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Eliza worked for 45 hours this week. What is her total earnings for this week? Let's think step by step Eliza worked for 40 hours at a regular rate of $10 per hour, so she earned 40*$10 = $400 For the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza's hourly rate is 1.2*$10 = $12 per hour So, for the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza earned 5*$12 = $60 Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week is $400 + $60 = $460 The answer is $460.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. Find the total number of downloads over the three months. Let's think step by step The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, meaning there were 3*60=180 downloads in the second month. In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, meaning there were 0.7*180=126 downloads in the third month. The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads in each month, so it is 60+180+126=366 downloads. The answer is 366.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Toula bought pastries from the bakery. She bought 3 dozen donuts for $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes for $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. What is the total cost of all the pastries? Let's think step by step Three dozen donuts is equal to 3*12=36 donuts. The cost of 1 dozen donuts is $68, so the cost of 36 donuts is 68*3=$204 Two dozen mini cupcakes is equal to 2*12=24 mini cupcakes. The cost of 1 dozen mini cupcakes is $80, so the cost of 24 mini cupcakes is 80*2=$160 Six dozen mini cheesecakes is equal to 6*12=72 mini cheesecakes. The cost of 1 dozen mini cheesecakes is $55, so the cost of 72 mini cheesecakes is 55*6=$330 The total cost of all the pastries is the sum of the cost of donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes, so it is 204+160+330=$694 The answer is $694.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree? Let's think step by step Carlos earns $1.5 for each of the 7 lemons the tree grows, so he earns 1.5*7 = $10.5 per year. It costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year, so Carlos earns a net profit of $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year. To recoup the $90 cost of planting the tree, Carlos needs to earn $90 / $7.5 = 12 years of net profit. Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is 12.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left. How many vacuum cleaners did she start with? Let's think step by step Let's start by working backwards. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then before she sold any to the orange house, she had 5*2=10 vacuum cleaners. Before she sold any to the red house, she had 10-2=8 vacuum cleaners. Before she sold any to the green house, she had 8*3=24 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 24.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are 20 students in a dance class. 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance? Let's think step by step 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 20/100*20 = 4 students. The remaining students are 20-4 = 16 students. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25/100*16 = 4 students. The number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students, which is 16-4 = 12 students. Therefore, 12/20*100 = 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance. The answer is 60%.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information The merchant has two purchase options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The jewelry market is expected to go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise 1.2% within the same month. The merchant wants to maximize profit by making a choice. What is the profit at the end of the month? Let's think step by step If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will increase by 2.5% of $5,000, which is 0.025*5000 = $125 The new value of the jewelry will be $5,000+$125 = $5,125 If the electronic gadgets market goes up 1.2%, the value of the gadgets will increase by 1.2% of $8,000, which is 0.012*8000 = $96 The new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000+$96 = $8,096 If the merchant chooses to buy the jewelry, the profit at the end of the month will be $5,125-$5,000 = $125 If the merchant chooses to buy the electronic gadgets, the profit at the end of the month will be $8,096-$8,000 = $96 Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, they should choose to buy the jewelry. The profit at the end of the month will be $125. The answer is $125.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They travel westward for 80 miles and then northwards for 150 miles. What is the distance covered by each train in the two days? Let's think step by step Since both trains travel for 80 miles westward, the total distance covered by both trains is 80+80=160 miles. When they travel northwards, the distance covered by each train is the same since they both cover the same distance. Therefore, each train covers 150/2=75 miles northwards. The total distance covered by each train in the two days is the sum of the distance covered westward and northwards. Thus, each train covers 80+75=155 miles in the two days. The answer is 155 miles.

She works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach. What is her annual salary? Let's think step by step Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher, so her weekly salary as a teacher is 35*$20 = $700 Jill works 15 hours a week as a coach, so her weekly salary as a coach is 15*$30 = $450 Jill's total weekly salary is $700+$450 = $1150 Jill works 50 weeks a year, so her annual salary is 50*$1150 = $57,500 The answer is $57,500.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Claire eats a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast. She wants to know how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks. Let's think step by step There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4*7=28 days. If Claire eats a 3 egg omelet every morning, she will eat 3*28=84 eggs in 4 weeks. To find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen). 84/12=7 Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. The answer is 7.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. What speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance? Let's think step by step Marissa has already walked 4+2=6 miles in 2 hours. She has 12-6=6 miles left to walk. To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 6/4=1.5 hours. Therefore, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6/1.5=4 miles per hour. The answer is 4 miles per hour.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water. There are also 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. One liter of the orange drink is spilled while pouring it into the pineapple drink. Find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Let's think step by step Two-thirds of the 10 liters of orange drink is water, so there are 2/3*10 = 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink. Three-fifths of the 15 liters of pineapple drink is water, so there are 3/5*15 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink. After spilling one liter of the orange drink, there are 10-1 = 9 liters of orange drink left. When the remaining orange drink is added to the pineapple drink, there will be a total of 9+15 = 24 liters of drink. The total amount of water in the 24 liters of drink is 6.67+9 = 15.67 liters of water. The answer is 15.67 liters of water.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Raymond is older than Samantha by 6 years. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. Samantha is currently 31 years old. How many years ago was Raymond's son born? Let's think step by step If Samantha is currently 31 years old, and Raymond is 6 years older than her, then Raymond is currently 31+6=37 years old. If Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old, then his son is currently 37-23=14 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract his age from the current year. If his son is currently 14 years old, then he was born 14 years ago. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. The answer is 14.

One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. Find the total amount of money Mishka spent on all the clothing items. Let's think step by step Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, and one pair costs $16.50, so she spent 3*$16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. She also bought 3 pairs of pants, and one pair costs $22.50, so she spent 3*$22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Mishka also bought 3 pairs of shoes, and one pair costs $42, so she spent 3*$42 = $126 on shoes. The total amount of money Mishka spent on all the clothing items is $49.50+$67.50+$126 = $243 The answer is $243.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton. After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream? Let's think step by step In 60 days, Cynthia will eat 60 servings of ice cream since she eats one serving every night. One carton of ice cream has 15 servings, so Cynthia will need 60/15=4 cartons of ice cream in 60 days. Each carton of ice cream costs $4.00, so Cynthia will spend 4*4=$16.00 on ice cream in 60 days. The answer is $16.00.

The cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. What is the cost of the boots? Let's think step by step If one pair of heels costs $33, then the other pair costs 2*$33 = $66 The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33+$66 = $99 If the cost of the two pairs of heels is five dollars less than the boots, then the boots cost $99+$5 = $104 Therefore, the boots cost $104 The answer is $104.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. Their total age now is 162. What will be Allen's age in 10 years? Let's think step by step Let's assume that Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a constant. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 7x+11x=18x, which is equal to 162. Therefore, 18x=162 Dividing both sides by 18 gives x=9 So Darrell's age is 7x9=63 and Allen's age is 11x9=99 In 10 years, Allen's age will be 99+10=109 The answer is 109.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Gunter asks his friends how many jelly beans are in a jar. One friend guesses 80. Another guesses 20 more than half the first guess. A third guesses 25% more than the first guess. What is the average of their guesses? Let's think step by step The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first guess, which is 20 + (1/2)*80 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first guess, which is 1.25*80 = 100 jelly beans. To find the average of their guesses, we add up all three guesses and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100)/3 = 80 The average guess is 80 jelly beans. The answer is 80.

How many hours a week does John spend taking care of dogs? Let's think step by step Each dog takes .5 hours a day to take care of, so 10 dogs will take 10*.5=5 hours a day to take care of. Since there are 7 days in a week, John will spend 5*7=35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is 35.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Find the number of gold coins Gretchen has. Let's think step by step Let's assume Gretchen has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has x+30 gold coins. The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of the number of gold and silver coins, which is x+(x+30)=2x+30. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so we can set up an equation: 2x+30=110. Solving for x, we get x=40. Therefore, Gretchen has x+30=70 gold coins. The answer is 70.

In total, Mike scores 4+5=9 points in 40 minutes. The answer is 9.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. How much will Terry spend on yogurt over 30 days? Let's think step by step Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, he will need 2*30=60 yogurts for 30 days. The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so one yogurt costs $5.00/4 = $1.25 To buy 60 yogurts, Terry will spend 60*$1.25 = $75.00 The answer is $75.00.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information John has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He uses the money to buy 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have? Let's think step by step The total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets is 13*$15 = $195 He uses this money to buy 8 video games for $20 each, which is a total of 8*$20 = $160 After buying the video games, he has $195-$160 = $35 left Since John sold all his lego sets, he doesn't have any left, so the answer is 0. The answer is 0.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs. What is his running speed? Let's think step by step If John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, he runs an average of 60/3=20 miles per day. On the first day, he runs 3 hours, so his average speed is 20/3=6.67 miles per hour. On the other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs for 1.5 hours each day. If he runs 20 miles in 1.5 hours, his average speed is 20/1.5=13.33 miles per hour. Therefore, John's running speed is a combination of 6.67 miles per hour and 13.33 miles per hour. The answer is a combination of 6.67 miles per hour and 13.33 miles per hour.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. She can skip at 3 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of six hours running and two-thirds walking, how many miles can she travel in total? Let's think step by step If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 2*3=6 miles per hour (since she runs four times faster than she walks). If she spends one-third of six hours running, then she runs for 6*(1/3)=2 hours. If she spends two-thirds of six hours walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=4 hours. In two hours, she can run 6*2=12 miles. In four hours, she can walk 3*4=12 miles (since she walks at 3 miles per hour). Therefore, in total, she can travel 12+12=24 miles. The answer is 24.

Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. How old is Brandon's iPhone? Let's think step by step If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, then Ben's iPhone is 2*1=2 years old. If Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4*2=8 years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is 8.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet, which is within the reach of the dragon's flames. However, when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. What is the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone? Let's think step by step If Polly can throw the javelin three times farther when holding the sapphire gemstone, then she can throw it for a distance of 3*400 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly needs to stand at a distance greater than 1000 feet + 400 feet (the distance she can throw without the gemstone) = 1400 feet. Therefore, the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone is 1200 feet, which is within the range of the dragon's flames. The answer is 1200 feet.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each pie cut into 8 pieces. She set the pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many pieces of pie were taken by the guests? Let's think step by step Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so there were a total of 5*8=40 pieces of pie. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining, so the guests must have taken 40-14=26 pieces of pie. The answer is 26.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information A 300g bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. The bag has 5 servings. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily calorie target is 2000, how many grams of chips can you eat? Let's think step by step The total number of calories in the bag of chips is 250*5=1250 calories If you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 2000-1800=200 calories left to consume. To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram of chips. Since the bag has 300g and 5 servings, each serving is 300/5=60g Therefore, each gram of chips has 1250/300=4.17 calories To consume 200 calories, you can eat 200/4.17= 47.99 grams of chips The answer is 47.99 grams (rounded to two decimal places)
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Charlie can make 10 tapered candles for every pound of beeswax. One pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles? Let's think step by step Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks that cost $10.00 to make 10 tapered candles. This means that the cost of making one tapered candle is $10.00/10 = $1.00 If he sells each candle for $2.00, his profit per candle is $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 If he makes and sells 20 candles, his total revenue will be 20 x $2.00 = $40.00 His total cost for supplies will be $10.00 for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks. His total cost for making 20 candles will be $1.00 x 20 = $20.00 His net profit will be his total revenue minus his total cost, which is $40.00 - $20.00 - $10.00 = $10.00 The answer is $10.00.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, and twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday on Wednesday. Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. What is the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days? Let's think step by step Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, which took 5*4=20 hours to research and write. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5*5=2 more articles than on Monday. The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2=7 articles. The total number of hours she spent writing articles on Tuesday is 7*4=28 hours. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2*7=14 articles. The total number of hours she spent writing articles on Wednesday is 14*4=56 hours. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20+28+56=104 hours. The answer is 104.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse. She bought a package of post-it notes on her way to work. At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall. How many post-it notes were in the package she purchased? Let's think step by step Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse before buying the package. She placed 220 post-it notes on cups of coffee at work, leaving her with 23 post-it notes remaining. Therefore, she used 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes in total. Since she bought a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes in the package is the difference between the total number of post-it notes used and the number she had before buying the package. Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package is 277 - 80 = 197. The answer is 197.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information John bought blue and red ties. He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total? Let's think step by step John bought blue ties that cost $40 each, and he spent $200 on them. Therefore, he bought 200/40=5 blue ties. Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2*5=10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $40*1.5=$60 each. Therefore, John spent 10*$60=$600 on red ties. In total, John spent $200+$600=$800 on ties. The answer is $800.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Tracy used a 4-foot long wire to support tomato plants in the garden. She cut the wire into pieces that are 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain? Let's think step by step Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the wire was 4*12=48 inches long. If Tracy cut the wire into pieces that are 6 inches long, she obtained 48/6=8 pieces. The answer is 8.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Richard's apartment building has 15 floors, with 8 units on each floor. 3/4 of the building is occupied. What is the total number of unoccupied units in the building? Let's think step by step The total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units. If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. 1/4 of 120 units is (1/4)*120 = 30 units. Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building. The answer is 30.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. He sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week? Let's think step by step In one day, Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs. In one week, which has 7 days, Lloyd's chickens produce 252*7=1764 eggs. Since a dozen has 12 eggs, Lloyd has 1764/12= 147 dozens of eggs. If Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, he makes 147*2= $294 on eggs per week. The answer is $294.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 to 4 PM and then travels back at a rate of 6 mph. How long does it take him to get back? Let's think step by step Tom travels at 10 mph from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. Therefore, he covers a distance of 10*3=30 miles. To travel back at a rate of 6 mph, he needs to cover the same distance of 30 miles. Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can solve for time. 30 = 6 x time time = 30/6 time = 5 hours Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back at a rate of 6 mph. The answer is 5 hours.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. He is removing 30 comic books. How many toys does he need to remove? Let's think step by step Uriah is removing 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so he is removing 30*(1/4) = 7.5 pounds of comic books. To remove a total of 15 pounds, he still needs to remove 15-7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove 7.5/(1/2) = 15 toys. The answer is 15.

Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information A wooden bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds. A delivery truck with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit? Let's think step by step The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. If we subtract this from the maximum weight the bridge can carry, we get 5000-3755=1245 pounds. This is the maximum weight the boxes can weigh in total. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight by the weight of each box to get the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. So, 1245/15=83 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The answer is 83.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Stephen's grocery order cost $40.00. The delivery vendor added a 25% fee and a $3.00 delivery fee. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. What was the final price of Stephen's groceries? Let's think step by step The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to Stephen's $40.00 order, which is 0.25*40 = $10.00 The delivery fee was $3.00 and the tip was $4.00 The total extra fees were $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00 The final price of Stephen's groceries was $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00 The answer is $57.00.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are 6 clusters of raspberries, each containing 20 fruits. There are also 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. Find the total number of raspberries. Let's think step by step The number of raspberries in each cluster is 20, and there are 6 clusters, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is 20*6=120 In addition to the clusters, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. The total number of raspberries is the sum of the raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries, so it is 120+67=187 The answer is 187.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are 25 oranges in a basket. One is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. Find the number of oranges that are good. Let's think step by step If 20% of the oranges are unripe, then the number of unripe oranges is 20/100*25 = 5 So far, we know that there are 1 bad orange, 5 unripe oranges, and 2 sour oranges, which means there are 1+5+2=8 oranges that are not good. Therefore, the number of good oranges is 25-8=17 The answer is 17.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She pays $500 for the material to make it and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. She then pays 10% of the total cost to get it insured. What is the total amount she paid? Let's think step by step The total cost of the brooch is $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler, so it is $500 + $800 = $1300 To get it insured, Janet pays 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1*$1300 = $130 The total amount she paid is the cost of the brooch plus the cost of insurance, so it is $1300 + $130 = $1430 The answer is $1430.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be? Let's think step by step Since Marcy works for 30 years, she is entitled to 30/40 = 3/4 of the full pension amount. The full pension amount is $50,000/year, so Marcy's entitled amount is 3/4*$50,000 = $37,500/year. Starting after 20 years, Marcy is entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since she worked for 30 years, she is entitled to an additional 10% (5% for each of the last 2 years) of the value of the pension. 10% of $37,500 is $3,750, so Marcy's annual pension will be $37,500 + $3,750 = $41,250/year. The answer is $41,250/year.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 per month. She was charged the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged 10% less money on the other half of the year. What is the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year? Let's think step by step The initial amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year is 6*$140 = $840 For the second half of the year, she was charged 10% less, which means she paid 10/100*$140 = $14 less per month So, for the second half of the year, she paid $140-$14 = $126 per month The total amount she paid for the second half of the year is 6*$126 = $756 Therefore, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840+$756 = $1596 The answer is $1596.

Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Luke is building a 4 leveled sandcastle. Each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level has a square footage of 16. What is the average square footage of a level? Let's think step by step If the top level has a square footage of 16, then the level below it has a square footage of 16*2=32 The third level has half the square footage of the second level, so it has a square footage of 32*0.5=16 The fourth level has half the square footage of the third level, so it has a square footage of 16*0.5=8 The total square footage of all four levels is 16+32+16+8=72 To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels, which is 4. So the average square footage of a level is 72/4=18 The answer is 18.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Cecilia has a new puppy. For the first 180 days, she has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. After that, she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. One bag of dog food contains 110 cups. How many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year? Let's think step by step For the first 180 days, Cecilia will use 1 cup of dog food every day, which is a total of 180 cups. For the remaining days of the year, which is 365-180=185 days, Cecilia will use 2 cups of dog food every day, which is a total of 2*185=370 cups. In total, Cecilia will use 180+370=550 cups of dog food in the first year. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550/110=5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is 5.

Let's think step by step The first time the alarm rang, it rang four times. The second time it rang, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4*3=12 times. The third time it rang, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12/2=6 times. In total, the alarm rang 4+12+6=22 times. The answer is 22.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information The company pays each employee $600 per month. The company increases the salaries of employees who have stayed for five years by 10% of their initial salary every year. Sylvie just completed five years in the company last December. What will be her annual salary after three more years of service? Let's think step by step Sylvie's initial salary was $600 per month, which means her initial annual salary was $600*12 = $7200 Since Sylvie completed five years in the company last December, her salary was increased by 10% of her initial salary for the past five years, which is 10%*$7200*5 = $3600 Sylvie's current annual salary is $7200+$3600 = $10800 If Sylvie continues to work for three more years, her salary will be increased by 10% of her current salary for each of those years. After one year, her salary will be increased by 10%*$10800 = $1080, making her new annual salary $10800+$1080 = $11880 After two years, her salary will be increased by 10%*$11880 = $1188, making her new annual salary $11880+$1188 = $13068 After three years, her salary will be increased by 10%*$13068 = $1307, making her new annual salary $13068+$1307 = $14375 The answer is $14375.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey. How old is Jackson? Let's think step by step Since James is 1 year younger than Corey and Corey is 2 years older than Amy, then James is 1+2=3 years younger than Amy. If James is 10, then Amy is 10+3=13 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson is 13-5=8 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 8 years old. The answer is 8.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. What is Gerald's time in seconds for the 400-meter hurdles with his improved speed? Let's think step by step If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, then Gerald's time without the diet improvement would be 38+2=40 seconds. If Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then his new time would be 40-(10% of 40)=36 seconds. Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds. The answer is 36.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are rabbits, dogs, and cats in a neighborhood. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. There are two cats for every dog, and there are 60 dogs. Find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. Let's think step by step If there are two cats for every dog, then the number of cats is 2*60=120 The combined number of dogs and cats is 120+60=180 Since the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, then the number of rabbits is 180-12=168 The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of rabbits, dogs, and cats, which is 168+60+120=348 The answer is 348.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are 200 Grade 5 students. 2/5 of them are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout? Let's think step by step If 2/5 of the students are boys, then 3/5 of them are girls. So, the number of girls is 3/5 x 200 = 120. If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, then 1/3 of them are not. So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 1/3 x 120 = 40. The answer is 40.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Harry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James? Let's think step by step James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so he slept 2/3*9 = 6 hours To find how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James' hours from Harry's hours: 9-6 = 3 hours The answer is 3.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Freda used canned tomatoes to make tomato sauce. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. When she cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Her last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did she use? Let's think step by step If each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, then each tomato weighs 16/3 = 5.33 ounces. When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that for every 16 ounces of canned tomatoes, she gets 8 ounces of tomato sauce. To make 32 ounces of tomato sauce, Freda needs 32/8 = 4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda used 4*3 = 12 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce. The answer is 12.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There were originally 30 cars on the motorway. Some of the cars drove through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. 5 cars from the line took an exit so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam. How many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes? Let's think step by step If 5 cars took an exit, then there were originally 30-5=25 cars that drove through the traffic jam. Let's assume that x cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Then, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, which means that 25-x cars drove through in the last 15 minutes. In total, 25 cars drove through the traffic jam, so we can set up an equation: x + (25-x) = 25 Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 15 Therefore, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 15.
Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. She received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with? Let's think step by step Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, meaning she has a total of 2*40=80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so she now has 80+18=98 potted plants. Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, meaning she will give away a total of 40*1=40 potted plants. After giving away 40 potted plants, Mary will remain with 98-40=58 potted plants. The answer is 58.
