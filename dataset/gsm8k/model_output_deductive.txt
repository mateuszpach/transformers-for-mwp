The variables in the task are: x = 16 - the number of eggs Janet's ducks lay per day y = 3 - the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast every morning z = 4 - the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins for her friends every day The goal is to find: r = ? - the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. x - y - z = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 - the number of eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market every day r = 9 * 2 = 18 - the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market The answer is $18.
The variables in the task are: x = 2 - the number of bolts of blue fiber needed y = 0.5 - half the number of bolts of white fiber needed The goal is to find: z = ? - the total number of bolts needed Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. x + y = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 - the total number of bolts needed The answer is 2.5 bolts.
The variables in the task are: x = 80,000 - the initial cost of the house y = 50,000 - the cost of repairs z = 150% - the increase in value of the house The goal is to find: r = ? - the profit Josh made Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. z/100 * (x + y) = 150/100 * (80,000 + 50,000) = 180,000 - the new value of the house r = (180,000 - x - y) = (180,000 - 80,000 - 50,000) = 50,000 - the profit Josh made The answer is 50,000.
