Let's think step by step Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and she eats three for breakfast and uses four for muffins, so she uses 3+4=7 eggs per day. The number of eggs remaining is 16-7=9 eggs per day. Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9*2=$18 per day. The answer is $18.
Let's think step by step If a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, then it takes half as much white fiber, which is 1 bolt. So in total, a robe takes 2+1=3 bolts of fiber. The answer is 3.
Let's think step by step Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs, so his total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value of the house is 250% of the original value. To find the original value, we divide the new value by 250%: $130,000 / 2.5 = $52,000 So the original value of the house was $52,000 The profit Josh made is the new value of the house minus his total cost: $130,000 - $52,000 = $78,000 The answer is $78,000.
Let's think step by step James runs 3 sprints, each sprint being 60 meters long, so he runs 3*60=180 meters in one session. He runs 3 times a week, so he runs 180*3=540 meters in a week. The answer is 540 meters.
Let's think step by step Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, so for 20 chickens, she needs 3*20=60 cups of feed per day. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed, so she has already given them 15+25=40 cups of feed. To meet the daily requirement of 60 cups of feed, she needs to give them an additional 60-40=20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is 20 cups.
Let's think step by step Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so he'll buy 8 glasses at full price and 8 glasses at 60% of the price. The first 8 glasses will cost 8*$5 = $40 The next 8 glasses will cost 8*0.6*$5 = $24 The total cost for all 16 glasses is $40+$24 = $64 Kylar needs to pay $64 for the glasses. The answer is $64.
Let's think step by step If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, then Charleston has 4*20=80 sheep. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, then Toulouse has 2*80=160 sheep. Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 20+80+160=260 sheep. The answer is 260.
Let's think step by step Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it would take her 200/2=100 minutes to download the file without interruptions. 40% of the way through the download, Carla had downloaded 0.4*200=80 GB of the file. Then Windows forced a restart, which took 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla had to start the download from the beginning, so she had to download the remaining 200-80=120 GB of the file. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it would take Carla 120/2=60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB of the file. Adding the 20 minutes for the restart, the total time it took Carla to download the file is 80+20+60=160 minutes. The answer is 160 minutes.
Let's think step by step In the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 60*3=180 miles. In the next 2 hours, he is stuck in traffic and doesn't move, so he covers 0 miles. In the next half-hour, he drives at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 30*(1/2)=15 miles. In the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 80*1.5=120 miles. The total distance covered by John is 180+0+15+120=315 miles. However, since he turned around after the first 3 hours, he is actually 180 miles away from home. Therefore, he is 180-315=-135 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours. The answer is -135 miles (which means he is 135 miles away from home in the opposite direction).
Let's think step by step For the first 40 hours, Eliza earns $10 per hour, so her regular pay for those hours is 40*$10 = $400 For the additional 5 hours, Eliza receives overtime pay, which is 1.2*$10 = $12 per hour So for the additional 5 hours, Eliza earns 5*$12 = $60 in overtime pay Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week is $400 + $60 = $460 The answer is $460.
Let's think step by step The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, meaning there were 3*60=180 downloads in the second month. In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, meaning there were 0.7*180=126 downloads in the third month. The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads in each month, so it is 60+180+126=366 downloads. The answer is 366.
Let's think step by step Three dozen donuts is equal to 3*12=36 donuts At $68 per dozen, 36 donuts cost 68/12*36= $204 Two dozen mini cupcakes is equal to 2*12=24 mini cupcakes At $80 per dozen, 24 mini cupcakes cost 80/12*24= $160 Six dozen mini cheesecakes is equal to 6*12=72 mini cheesecakes At $55 per dozen, 72 mini cheesecakes cost 55/12*72= $330 The total cost of all the pastries is 204+160+330= $694 The answer is $694.
Let's think step by step Carlos will earn $1.5 for each of the 7 lemons the tree produces, so he will earn 7*$1.5=$10.5 per year. It will cost him $3 per year to water and feed the tree, so his net earnings per year will be $10.5-$3=$7.5 To recover the $90 he spent planting the tree, he will need to earn $90/$7.5=12 years. Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is 12.
Let's think step by step If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she sold a total of x-5 vacuum cleaners. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, meaning she sold (1/3)x at the green house. She sold 2 more to the red house, meaning she sold (1/3)x + 2 at the red house. The total number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green and red houses is (1/3)x + (1/3)x + 2 = (2/3)x + 2. She had x - (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green and red houses. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, meaning she sold (1/2)(x - (2/3)x - 2) = (1/2)(x/3 - 2) at the orange house. This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (1/2)(x/3 - 2) = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 33. Therefore, Melanie started with 33 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 33.
Let's think step by step 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, which is 0.2*20 = 4 students. The remaining number of students is 20-4 = 16 students. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25*16 = 4 students. The total number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance is 4+4 = 8 students. Therefore, the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 20-8 = 12 students. To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12/20)*100 = 60%. The answer is 60%.
Let's think step by step If the jewelry market goes up 2.5%, the value of the jewelry will increase by 2.5% of $5,000 which is 0.025*5000 = $125 The new value of the jewelry will be $5,000+$125 = $5,125 If the electronic gadgets market goes up 1.2%, the value of the gadgets will increase by 1.2% of $8,000 which is 0.012*8000 = $96 The new value of the electronic gadgets will be $8,000+$96 = $8,096 If the merchant chooses to purchase the jewelry, his profit will be $5,125-$5,000 = $125 If the merchant chooses to purchase the electronic gadgets, his profit will be $8,096-$8,000 = $96 Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, he should choose to purchase the electronic gadgets. The profit he will make at the end of the month is $96. The answer is $96.
Let's think step by step Since both trains travel for 80 miles westward, the total distance covered by both trains is 80+80=160 miles. On the next day, both trains travel northwards for 150 miles each, so the total distance covered by both trains is 150+150=300 miles. Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is half of the total distance covered by both trains, which is 300+160=460 miles. So each train covered 460/2= 230 miles in the two days. The answer is 230 miles.
Let's think step by step Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher, and she gets paid $20 per hour, so she earns 35*20 = $700 per week as a teacher. Jill also works 15 hours a week as a cheerleading coach, and she gets paid $30 per hour, so she earns 15*30 = $450 per week as a coach. In total, Jill earns 700+450 = $1150 per week. If Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary will be 50*1150 = $57,500. The answer is $57,500.
Let's think step by step There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, Claire eats 3*7=21 eggs. In 4 weeks, she eats 21*4=84 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Claire will eat 84/12=7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. The answer is 7.
Let's think step by step Marissa has already walked 4+2=6 miles She has 12-6=6 miles left to walk She has already spent 1+1=2 hours walking To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to complete the remaining 6 miles in 6/4=1.5 hours Since she has already spent 2 hours walking, she has 1.5-2=-0.5 hours left to complete the remaining 6 miles Since time cannot be negative, it means she needs to walk faster than 12 miles per hour to complete the remaining 6 miles in negative time. Therefore, it is impossible for Marissa to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour if she wants to complete the trail.
Let's think step by step If the orange drink is two-thirds water, then one-third of it is not water. So, 10 liters of orange drink contains 10*(1/3) = 3.33 liters of non-water. Similarly, if the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, then two-fifths of it is not water. So, 15 liters of pineapple drink contains 15*(2/5) = 6 liters of non-water. When the 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 10-1 = 9 liters. When the two drinks are mixed, the total amount of water in the mixture is (9*(2/3)) + (15*(3/5)) = 10.8 liters. Since the total amount of liquid in the mixture is 9+15-1 = 23 liters, the remaining 24-23 = 1 liter must be water. Therefore, the remaining 24 liters of the mixture contains 10.8+1 = 11.8 liters of water. The answer is 11.8 liters.
Let's think step by step If Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, then Raymond is 31+6=37 years old. If Raymond had a son at the age of 23, then his son is currently 37-23=14 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract his age from the current year. Since his son is 14 years old, he was born 31-14=17 years ago. The answer is 17 years ago.
Let's think step by step Billy's first 3 customers buy one DVD each, so he sells 3*1=3 DVDs to them. His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so he sells 2*2=4 DVDs to them. His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so he doesn't sell any DVDs to them. In total, Billy sells 3+4=7 DVDs on Tuesday. The answer is 7.
Let's think step by step From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours. If the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, then it will melt by 2*4=8 centimeters in total. Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The answer is 8 centimeters.
Let's think step by step If Kyle bought the book for $19.50, and this is with a 25% discount, then the original price of the book was 100/75*19.50 = $26. The answer is $26.
Let's think step by step Marie bought 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each, so she spent 5*$3=$15 on milk. She also bought 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, so she spent 4*$1.50=$6 on apples. Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, so she spent $12 on the chicken meal. The total amount spent on milk, apples, and chicken meal is $15+$6+$12=$33 If Marie paid a total of $50, then the amount spent on pizza is $50-$33=$17 If each box of pizza costs $8.50, then the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17/$8.50=2 boxes. The answer is 2 boxes.
Let's think step by step Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, and one pair costs $16.50, so she spent 3*$16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. She also bought 3 pairs of pants, and one pair costs $22.50, so she spent 3*$22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Mishka also bought 3 pairs of shoes, and one pair costs $42, so she spent 3*$42 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50+$67.50+$126 = $243 on all the clothing items. The answer is $243.
Let's think step by step Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she'll eat 60 servings of ice cream. Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings, so Cynthia will need 60/15=4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton of ice cream costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4*4= $16.00 Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days. The answer is $16.00.
Let's think step by step Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, so he traveled 20 miles before his first stop. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so he traveled 60-15=45 miles after his second stop. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 45-20=25 miles. The answer is 25.
Let's think step by step If one pair of heels costs $33, then the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33*2=$66 Together, the two pairs of heels cost $33+$66=$99 If the two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots, then the boots cost $99+$5=$104 Therefore, the boots cost $104 The answer is $104.
Let's think step by step The total ratio representing Darrell and Allen's ages is 7+11=18 If we divide their total age by the total ratio, we can find the value of one part of the ratio, which is 162/18=9 If Darrell's age is represented by 7 parts of the ratio, then his current age is 7*9=63 If Allen's age is represented by 11 parts of the ratio, then his current age is 11*9=99 Ten years from now, Darrell's age will be 63+10=73 Ten years from now, Allen's age will be 99+10=109 The answer is 109.
Let's think step by step The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first one, which is 20+(1/2)*80=60 jelly beans. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first one, which is 1.25*80=100 jelly beans. To find the average guess, we add up all three guesses and divide by 3: (80+60+100)/3 = 80 jelly beans. The answer is 80.
Let's think step by step If John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business, then John spends 10*.5=5 hours a day taking care of dogs. Since there are 7 days in a week, John spends 5*7=35 hours a week taking care of dogs. The answer is 35.
Let's think step by step Let's assume Gretchen has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has x+30 gold coins. The total number of coins Gretchen has is 110, so we can write an equation: x + (x+30) = 110 Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 30 = 110 Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80 Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40 So Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40+30=70 gold coins. The answer is 70.
Let's think step by step Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2=20 jewels Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, meaning Aaron has 20+5=25 jewels Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning Siobhan has 25-2=23 jewels Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The answer is 23.
Let's think step by step In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than the first 20 minutes, which is 0.25*4=1 more point. So in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4+1=5 points. In total, Mike scores 4+5=9 points in 40 minutes. The answer is 9.
Let's think step by step Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he will eat 2*30=60 yogurts. The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, meaning each yogurt costs $5.00/4= $1.25 To find out how much Terry will spend on yogurt over 30 days, we need to multiply the cost per yogurt by the number of yogurts he will eat, so it is $1.25*60= $75.00 The answer is $75.00.
Let's think step by step John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13*15=$195 He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends 8*20=$160 After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so he had $195 - $160 + $5 = $40 before buying the video games. Since he sold each lego set for $15, he must have sold $195/$15 = 13 lego sets. If he still has some lego sets left, he must have sold less than 13. Let's say he sold x lego sets, then he has 13 - x lego sets left. The money he earned from selling the x lego sets is x*15. He spent $160 on video games and had $5 left, so he spent $195 - $5 = $190 in total. Therefore, the money he earned from selling the x lego sets must be $190 - $160 = $30. So, x*15 = $30, which means x = 2. Therefore, John sold 2 lego sets and has 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets left. The answer is 11.
Let's think step by step If John runs 60 miles a week and runs 3 days a week, he runs an average of 60/3=20 miles per day. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so his average speed is 20/3=6.67 miles per hour. On the other two days, he runs half as much, so he runs for 3/2=1.5 hours each day. If he runs 20 miles in 1.5 hours, his average speed is 20/1.5=13.33 miles per hour. Therefore, John's average speed is a weighted average of his speeds on the three days, where the weights are the number of miles he runs each day. The weighted average is (3/7)*6.67 + (2/7)*13.33 = 8.57 miles per hour. The answer is 8.57 miles per hour.
Let's think step by step If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at a speed of 2*3=6 miles per hour. She can also walk at a speed of 6/4=1.5 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, then she spends 1/3*6=2 hours running and 2/3*6=4 hours walking. During the 2 hours she spends running, she can travel a distance of 6*2=12 miles. During the 4 hours she spends walking, she can travel a distance of 1.5*4=6 miles. In total, she can travel a distance of 12+6=18 miles in six hours. The answer is 18.
Let's think step by step If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, then Ben's iPhone is 2*1=2 years old. If Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, then Brandon's iPhone is 4*2=8 years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is 8.
Let's think step by step Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, meaning she can throw it for a distance of 3*400=1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly needs to stand at least 1200-1000=200 feet away from the dragon to hit it with the javelin. Therefore, Polly can stand up to 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. The answer is 200 feet.
Let's think step by step Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so there were 5*8=40 pieces of pie in total. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining, so the guests must have taken 40-14=26 pieces of pie. The answer is 26.
Let's think step by step If a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving, then a 300g bag with 5 servings has a total of 5*250=1250 calories. If you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily calorie target is 2000, then you have 2000-1800=200 calories left. To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, you need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram of chips. Since the bag has 1250 calories in 300g, there are 1250/300=4.17 calories per gram of chips. Dividing the remaining 200 calories by 4.17 calories per gram gives you 47.88 grams of chips. Therefore, you can eat 47.88 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. The answer is 47.88 grams.
Let's think step by step For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles. If he makes 20 candles, he'll need 20/10= 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2*$10.00= $20.00 If he sells each candle for $2.00, he'll make 20*$2.00= $40.00 His net profit is the revenue minus the cost, so it is $40.00-$20.00= $20.00 The answer is $20.00.
Let's think step by step Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, which took 5*4=20 hours to research and write. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5*5=2 more articles. So, she wrote a total of 5+2=7 articles on Tuesday. It takes 4 hours to write one article, so she spent 7*4=28 hours writing on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2*7=14 articles. So, she spent 14*4=56 hours writing on Wednesday. The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 20+28+56=104 hours. The answer is 104.
Let's think step by step Candice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse. At work, she used 220 post-it notes on cups of coffee. She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, so she used a total of 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes. Since she purchased a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes in the package is the difference between the total number of post-it notes used and the number she started with, which is 277 - 80 = 197 post-it notes. The answer is 197.
Let's think step by step John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, meaning he bought 2*200/40= 10 blue ties. He also bought 2*10= 20 red ties. If blue ties cost $40 each, he spent 40*10= $<<40*10=400>>400 on blue ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, meaning they cost 1.5*40= $<<1.5*40=60>>60 each. He bought 20 red ties, so he spent 20*60= $<<20*60=1200>>1200 on red ties. In total, he spent 1200+400= $<<1200+400=1600>>1600 on ties. The answer is 1600.
Let's think step by step Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the wire was 4*12=48 inches long. If the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, the number of pieces obtained is 48/6=8 pieces. The answer is 8.
Let's think step by step The total number of units in the building is 15 floors * 8 units per floor = 120 units If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then 1/4 of the building is unoccupied. The number of unoccupied units is 1/4 * 120 units = 30 units The answer is 30 units.
Let's think step by step Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lloyd's chickens produce 252/12= 21 dozens of eggs per day. If he sells each dozen for $2, he makes 21*2= $42 per day. In a week, he makes 7*$42= $294 on eggs. The answer is $294.
Let's think step by step Tom travels for 3 hours from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour, he covers a distance of 10*3=30 miles. When he travels back at 6 miles per hour, the distance he covers is still 30 miles. Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can solve for the time it takes him to travel back. 30 = 6 x time time = 30/6 time = 5 hours The answer is 5 hours.
Let's think step by step Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. If he removes 30 comic books, he'll remove 30*1/4 = 7.5 pounds from his book bag. He still needs to remove 15-7.5 = 7.5 pounds from his book bag. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so he needs to remove 7.5/(1/2) = 15 toys from his book bag. The answer is 15 toys.
Let's think step by step On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, so he earns 6*60=$360 from truck tires. He also repairs 4 car tires, so he earns 4*40=$160 from car tires. In total, he earns 360+160=$520 on Thursday. On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires, so he earns 12*40=$480 from car tires. He doesn't repair any truck tires, so he earns $0 from truck tires on Friday. In total, he earns $480 on Friday. The day with higher revenue is Thursday, where he earned $520. The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is 520-480=$40. The answer is $40.
Let's think step by step If Trixie had 12 kittens, and Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens, then Patchy had 3*7=21 kittens. Altogether, the Doubtfire family now has 7+21+12=40 kittens. The answer is 40.
Let's think step by step Jean starts with 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 lollipops, so she has 30-2=28 lollipops left. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the number of lollipops by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14. Jean can fill 14 bags. The answer is 14.
Let's think step by step Peter spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn, so he spends a total of $7+$7=$14 per movie. If he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $42/$14=3 times. The answer is 3.
Let's think step by step The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we can divide the maximum weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83. The answer is 83.
Let's think step by step Stephen's final bill for groceries was $40.00 The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to his final total, which is 0.25*40 = $10.00 The delivery vendor also charged him $3.00 in delivery fees and Stephen added a $4.00 tip The total extra fees are $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00 The final price of Stephen's groceries after the extra fees is $40.00 + $17.00 = $57.00 The answer is $57.00.
Let's think step by step The number of raspberries in each cluster is 20, and there are 6 clusters, so there are 20*6=120 raspberries in the clusters. In addition to the clusters, there are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush. Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 120+67=187 raspberries. The answer is 187.
Let's think step by step Out of the 25 oranges, 1 is bad, so there are 25-1=24 oranges that are not bad. 20% of the oranges are unripe, which means 20/100*24=4.8 oranges are unripe. Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we round up to 5 unripe oranges. 2 oranges are sour, so the total number of oranges that are either bad, unripe or sour is 1+5+2=8 Therefore, the number of oranges that are good is 25-8=17 The answer is 17.
Let's think step by step Janet pays $500 for the material to make the brooch and $800 for the jeweler to construct it, so the total cost is $500 + $800 = $1300. To insure the brooch, she pays 10% of the total cost, which is 0.1*$1300 = $130. Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1300 + $130 = $1430 for the brooch. The answer is $1430.
Let's think step by step If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. So after 20 years, her pension will increase by 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500/year. After 21 years, her pension will increase by another 5% of $52,500, which is $2,625/year. This pattern continues until she quits after 30 years. So her pension will increase by 5% of the previous year's pension each year for 10 years. To calculate her pension after 30 years, we need to calculate the value of her pension after 20 years and then add the increases for the next 10 years. After 20 years, her pension is $50,000/year. After 21 years, her pension is $52,500/year. After 22 years, her pension is $55,125/year. After 23 years, her pension is $57,881.25/year. After 24 years, her pension is $60,775.31/year. After 25 years, her pension is $63,814.08/year. After 26 years, her pension is $67,005.78/year. After 27 years, her pension is $70,359.07/year. After 28 years, her pension is $73,882.02/year. After 29 years, her pension is $77,583.12/year. After 30 years, her pension is $81,471.28/year. The answer is $81,471.28/year.
Let's think step by step If Aleena was charged $140 per month, she was charged $140*6 = $840 for the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, she was charged 10% less, which means she was charged $140 - ($140*10/100) = $126 per month. For the second half of the year, she was charged $126*6 = $756 The total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596 The answer is $1596.
Let's think step by step Sophia used 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank after traveling 100 miles. This means that her car's gas mileage is 100/4 = 25 miles per gallon. If her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, then she can drive 12*25 = 300 miles on a single tank of gas. The answer is 300 miles.
Let's think step by step Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2/2=1 hour. So, Jim spends a total of 2+1=3 hours on TV and reading each day. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends a total of 3*3=9 hours on TV and reading each week. In 4 weeks, he spends 4*9=36 hours on TV and reading. The answer is 36.
Let's think step by step Each school has sent 2 basketball teams, a girls' team and a boys' team, so that's 2*4=8 teams in total. Each team has 5 players and there are 8 teams, so there are 5*8=40 players in total. Each team also has a coach, so there are 8*2=16 coaches in total. Adding the players and coaches together, there are 40+16=56 people that all of the schools have sent. The answer is 56.
Let's think step by step If there were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, then the number of rubies is 175-35=140 If there were twice the number of emeralds than rubies, then the number of emeralds is 2*140=280 In total, the chest had 175+140+280=595 gems. The answer is 595.
Let's think step by step If there are twice as many boys as girls, then there are 2*60=120 boys at the school. The total number of students at the school is 60+120=180 If there are 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is 180/5=36 The answer is 36.
Let's think step by step Bailey receives $5 every week for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of $5*8 = $40 in allowance. If Bailey ends up with $100 at the end of the 8 weeks, then the amount of money she started with plus her allowance must equal $100. Let's call the amount of money she started with "x". So we can write an equation: x + $40 = $100 To solve for x, we can subtract $40 from both sides: x = $100 - $40 = $60 Therefore, Bailey started with $60. The answer is $60.
Let's think step by step Judy teaches 5 dance classes every weekday, so she teaches 5*5=25 classes on weekdays. She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so she teaches a total of 25+8=33 classes in a week. If each class has 15 students, then she teaches a total of 33*15=495 students in a week. If she charges $15.00 per student, then she makes a total of 495*15=$7,425.00 in a week. The answer is $7,425.00.
Let's think step by step The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, meaning it has 2*20=40 instructions. To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read 20+40=60 instructions in total. The answer is 60.
Let's think step by step Tommy sells 43 brownies for $3 each, so he makes 43*3 = $129 from brownies He also sells 23 slices of cheesecake for $4 each, so he makes 23*4 = $92 from cheesecake In total, Tommy raises $129+$92 = $221 The answer is $221.
Let's think step by step Shiela bought five cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost is 5*$150 = $750 A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the total interest is 2%*$750 = $15 The total amount Shiela needs to pay is $750+$15 = $765 Since Shiela will pay for 3 months, she needs to divide the total amount by 3 to get the monthly payment. So, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $255 each month for 3 months. The answer is $255.
Let's think step by step Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds for $2.74 per pot, so he'll round it to $3 per pot. He sells 9 pots of petunias for $1.87 per pot, so he'll round it to $2 per pot. He sells 17 pots of begonias for $2.12 per pot, so he'll round it to $2 per pot. So, Artie will sell 12*3= $36 worth of marigolds He will sell 9*2= $18 worth of petunias He will sell 17*2= $34 worth of begonias In total, Artie will make 36+18+34= $88 The answer is $88.
Let's think step by step If the top level has a square footage of 16, then the level below it will have a square footage of 2*16=32 The level below that will have a square footage of 2*32=64 The bottom level will have a square footage of 2*64=128 The total square footage of all levels combined is 16+32+64+128=240 Since there are 4 levels, the average square footage of a level is 240/4=60 The answer is 60.
Let's think step by step For the first 180 days, Cecilia will need 1 cup of dog food per day, so she will need 1*180=180 cups of dog food. For the rest of the year, which is 365-180=185 days, Cecilia will need 2 cups of dog food per day, so she will need 2*185=370 cups of dog food. In total, for the first year, Cecilia will need 180+370=550 cups of dog food. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will need 550/110=5 bags of dog food for the first year. The answer is 5.
Let's think step by step If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400/4=100 pounds of laundry. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, meaning he does 1/2*400=200 pounds of laundry. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100=100 pounds. The answer is 100.
Let's think step by step If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50, each flower costs $2.50/3 = $0.83 If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1, each flower costs $1/2 = $0.50 To buy 18 flowers, Vincent can buy 6 packages of 3 for a total cost of 6*$2.50 = $15 Alternatively, he can buy 9 packages of 2 for a total cost of 9*$1 = $9 By buying at the better price, Vincent saves $15-$9 = $6 The answer is $6.

Let's think step by step Charlie had 10 stickers to start with. He bought 21 stickers from the store, so he had 10+21=31 stickers. He also got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he had 31+23=54 stickers. Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54-9=45 stickers left. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he had 45-28=17 stickers left. The answer is 17.
Let's think step by step Four times what Grace weighs is 4*125=500 pounds Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, meaning Alex weighs 500-2=498 pounds The combined weight of Grace and Alex is 125+498=623 pounds The answer is 623.
Let's think step by step Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is 3*25=75 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns, so the total number of thorns is 75*8=600 thorns. The answer is 600.
Let's think step by step Let's call the number of games they lost "x" Since they won 8 more than they lost, the number of games they won is "x+8" The total number of games they played is 22, so we can write an equation: x + (x+8) = 22 Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22 Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14 Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7 So they lost 7 games, and they won x+8 = 7+8 = 15 games The answer is 15
Let's think step by step Gene has been vacationing for 34-23=11 years He goes on four vacations a year, so he has 11*4=44 vacation shirts Therefore, he has 44 quilt blocks in total The answer is 44.
Let's think step by step The first time the alarm went off, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang for 4*3=12 times. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang for 12/2=6 times. In total, the alarm rang 4+12+6=22 times. The answer is 22.
Let's think step by step Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600 Since she has worked for 5 years, her salary has been increased by 10% of her initial salary every year for the past 5 years. This means her salary has been increased by 10/100*$600 = $60 every year for the past 5 years. So her current monthly salary is $600+$60*5 = $900 If she works for three more years, her salary will be increased by 10% of her current salary every year for the next three years. This means her salary will be increased by 10/100*$900 = $90 every year for the next three years. So her annual salary after three more years of service will be $900+$90*3 = $1170 The answer is $1170.
Let's think step by step Let's call the number of copies Harald sold "x" Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. Together, they sold x + 10x = 11x copies. We know that they sold 88,000 copies combined, so 11x = 88,000. Solving for x, we get x = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The answer is 8,000.
Let's think step by step If Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of attendees don't show up, then the number of guests who will actually attend is 16 - (1/4)*16 = 12 Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, so she needs .75*12 = 9 gift bags Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost of the gift bags will be 9*$2 = $18 The answer is $18.
Let's think step by step An adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult, so a child will eat 10/2=5 lbs of potato salad. There will be 20 adults at the picnic, so they will eat 20*10=200 lbs of potato salad. There will also be 5 children at the picnic, so they will eat 5*5=25 lbs of potato salad. In total, the picnic attendees will eat 200+25=225 lbs of potato salad. Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone. The answer is 225.
Let's think step by step If Cindy has four pets, and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, then Marcia has 4+2=6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, meaning Jan has 3*6=18 pets. Together, the three of them have 4+6+18=28 pets. The answer is 28.
Let's think step by step If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, then Corey is 10+1=11 years old. If Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, then Amy is 11-2=9 years old. If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson is 9-5=4 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is 4.
Let's think step by step If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, then Gerald's time is 38+2=40 seconds. If Gerald improved his speed by 10%, then his new time is 40 - (10% of 40) = 36 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds. The answer is 36.
Let's think step by step If there are two cats for every dog, then the number of cats is 2*60=120 The combined number of dogs and cats is 120+60=180 If the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, then the number of rabbits is 180-12=168 The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats, which is 168+60+120=348 The answer is 348.
Let's think step by step If 2/5 of the students are boys, then 3/5 of the students are girls. So, there are 3/5 x 200 = 120 girls in Grade 5. If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, then 1/3 of the girls are not in the girl scout. So, there are 1/3 x 120 = 40 girls who are not in the girl scout. The answer is 40.
Let's think step by step James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so he slept 2/3*9=6 hours. Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours, so Harry slept 9-6=3 more hours than James. The answer is 3.
Let's think step by step If the canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, then Freda used 32*2=64 ounces of canned tomatoes to make the sauce. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, so Freda used 64/16=4 cans of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 4*3=12 tomatoes to make the sauce. The answer is 12.
Let's think step by step If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway and 5 cars took an exit, then there were 30-5=25 cars left on the motorway. If 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam, then there were 25-20=5 cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes of the jam. Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5.
Let's think step by step Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, meaning she has a total of 2*40=80 potted plants. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants, so she now has 80+18=98 potted plants. Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, meaning she will give away a total of 40*1=40 potted plants. After giving away 40 potted plants, Mary will remain with 98-40=58 potted plants. The answer is 58.
