Model answer: #24# extracted from "The variables in the task are: p = 16 - the number of people at the dinner party r = 40 - the number of dinner rolls available h = 0.5 - the fraction of people who eat 1 1/2 rolls each q = 1.5 - the number of rolls eaten by each person in the first half t = 0.5 - the fraction of people who eat 1/2 a roll each s = 0.5 - the number of rolls eaten by each person in the second half The goal is to find: l = ? - the number of dinner rolls leftover Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. p * h = 16 * 0.5 = 8 - the number of people who eat 1 1/2 rolls each p * t = 16 * 0.5 = 8 - the number of people who eat 1/2 a roll each (p * h) * q = 8 * 1.5 = 12 - the number of rolls eaten by the first half (p * t) * s = 8 * 0.5 = 4 - the number of rolls eaten by the second half (p * h) * q + (p * t) * s = 12 + 4 = 16 - the total number of rolls eaten r - (p * h) * q - (p * t) * s = 40 - 16 = 24 - the number of dinner rolls leftover The answer is 24."

The correct answer is: #30#
Model answer: #30# extracted from "The variables in the task are: r = 6 - the speed at which Rosie runs in miles per hour m = 60 - the number of minutes in an hour t1 = 1 - the number of hours Rosie runs on Monday t2 = 30 - the number of minutes Rosie runs on Tuesday t3 = 1 - the number of hours Rosie runs on Wednesday t4 = 20 - the number of minutes Rosie runs on Thursday w = 20 - the number of miles Rosie wants to run for the week The goal is to find: t5 = ? - the number of minutes Rosie should run on Friday Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. r * t1 = 6 * 1 = 6 - the number of miles Rosie runs on Monday r * (t2 / m) = 6 * (30 / 60) = 3 - the number of miles Rosie runs on Tuesday r * t3 = 6 * 1 = 6 - the number of miles Rosie runs on Wednesday r * (t4 / m) = 6 * (20 / 60) = 2 - the number of miles Rosie runs on Thursday (r * t1) + (r * (t2 / m)) + (r * t3) + (r * (t4 / m)) = 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 - the total number of miles Rosie runs for the week until Thursday w - 17 = 20 - 17 = 3 - the number of miles Rosie needs to run on Friday r * (t5 / m) = 3 - the number of miles Rosie needs to run on Friday in terms of minutes t5 = (3 * m) / r = (3 * 60) / 6 = 30 - the number of minutes Rosie should run on Friday The answer is 30."

The correct answer is: #150#
Model answer: #150# extracted from "The variables in the task are: p = $6,000 - the price of the car t1 = 5 - the number of years Gary's dad gave him to pay back the loan t2 = 2 - the number of years Gary decided to pay back the loan The goal is to find: d = ? - how much more Gary is spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 Let's sequentially expand the variables list until we find the answer. p / t1 = 6000 / 5 = 1200 - the amount Gary needs to pay his dad per year if he pays the loan off in 5 years p / t2 = 6000 / 2 = 3000 - the amount Gary needs to pay his dad per year if he pays the loan off in 2 years (p / t2) - (p / t1) = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 - the difference in the amount Gary needs to pay his dad per year if he pays the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 d = 1800 / (12 * (t2 - t1)) = 1800 / (12 * (2 - 5)) = 150 - the amount more Gary is spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5 The answer is $150 more per month."
