The correct answer is: #5#
Model answer: #7# extracted from "Let's think step by step Tobias has been saving up for three months, so he has saved a total of 3*$5 = $15 from his allowance. Let's call the amount of money he earned from mowing lawns "L" and the amount he earned from shoveling driveways "D". So, we know that L + D = the total amount of money he earned. We also know that he earned enough to buy the shoes and have $15 in change, so L + D = $95 + $15 = $110. If he mows 4 lawns, he earns 4*$15 = $60 from mowing. So, we can subtract that from the total amount he earned to find out how much he earned from shoveling: D = $110 - $60 = $50. To find out how many driveways he shoveled, we need to divide the amount he earned from shoveling by the price he charges per driveway: $50 / $7 = 7.14. Since he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway, we know he shoveled 7 driveways. The answer is 7."

The correct answer is: #7#
Model answer: #7# extracted from "Let's think step by step If Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name, and we don't know the length of Bobbie's last name, we can represent it as x. Therefore, Samantha's last name has x-3 letters. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name that is x-2 letters long. If Bobbie's shortened last name is twice the length of Jamie's last name, which is "Grey", then we can represent Jamie's last name as y, and we have the equation x-2=2y. Simplifying this equation, we get x=2y+2. We can substitute this value of x into the expression for Samantha's last name to get the equation Samantha's last name has 2y-1 letters. Since we know Jamie's last name has 4 letters, we can substitute y=4 into the equation for Samantha's last name to get that Samantha's last name has 2(4)-1=7 letters. The answer is 7."

Model answer: #2400# extracted from "Let's think step by step If Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities, then she had 60% of her income left for other expenses. After her salary increase, if her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income, then she has 75% of her income left for other expenses. We can set up a proportion: 60/x = 75/(x+600), where x is her previous monthly income. Cross-multiplying, we get 60(x+600) = 75x Expanding the left side, we get 60x + 36000 = 75x Subtracting 60x from both sides, we get 36000 = 15x Dividing both sides by 15, we get x = 2400 Therefore, her previous monthly income was $2400.

The correct answer is: #9#
Model answer: #108# extracted from "Let's think step by step Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea, so the ratio of tea to cups is 1:8. For the party, each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, so the ratio of tea to cups is 1:6. To find out how much tea Artemis needs for the party, we need to find the equivalent ratio of tea to cups for the party. We can do this by multiplying the ratio of tea to cups for Artemis's mom by the number of cups needed for the party, which is 12*6=72 cups. So the equivalent ratio of tea to cups for the party is 1:72/8=1:9. This means that for every 9 cups of tea, Artemis can make 1 cup of tea for the party. Since she needs 12 cups of tea for the party, she will need 9*12=<<9*12=108>>108 ounces of tea. The answer is 108 ounces."

Model answer: #16# extracted from "Let's think step by step Since the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, let's call the number of each type of fish "x". So there are x clownfish and x blowfish in the aquarium. 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so there are x-26 blowfish in the display tank. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so there are also x-26 clownfish in the display tank. A third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, so (1/3)*(x-26) clownfish swim back. The remaining number of clownfish in the display tank is (x-26)-(1/3)*(x-26) = (2/3)*(x-26). The total number of fish in the aquarium is x+x=2x, which is equal to 100. So x=50, which means there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium. Therefore, there are (2/3)*(50-26) = 16 clownfish in the display tank. The answer is 16."

Model answer: #32# extracted from "Let's think step by step If the first spray kills 50% of germs, then it leaves 50% of germs remaining. If the second spray kills 25% of germs, then it leaves 75% of germs remaining. However, 5% of the germs killed by the second spray are the same ones killed by the first spray, so we need to subtract that 5% from the total percentage of germs remaining. To find the total percentage of germs remaining, we need to multiply the percentages of germs remaining after each spray: 50% * 75% = 37.5% Subtracting the 5% of overlapping germs, we get: 37.5% - 5% = 32.5% Therefore, after using both sanitizer sprays together, 32.5% of germs would be left.

Finally, they sold 80 Apple TVs for an average cost of $200 each, so they made 80*200 = $16,000 from Apple TVs. The total revenue from all products sold today is 100,000+18,000+16,000 = $134,000 The total number of products sold today is 100+20+80 = 200 The average cost across all products sold today is the total revenue divided by the total number of products sold, so it is 134,000/200 = $670 The answer is $670."

The correct answer is: #160#
Model answer: #240# extracted from "Let's think step by step If the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B, then the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 100% - 20% = 80% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet A. Let x be the height of the sunflowers from Packet B. Then we can write the equation: 0.8x = 192 (since 80% of x is equal to 192 inches). Solving for x, we get x = 192/0.8 = 240 inches. Therefore, the sunflowers from Packet B were 240 inches tall. The answer is 240."

The correct answer is: #30#
Model answer: #30# extracted from "Let's think step by step Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each, so she spent 5*$6=$30 on drinks. She also bought 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each, so she spent 10*$14=$140 on pizzas. In total, Mary spent $30+$140=$170 on all the items. If Mary paid $200 for all the items, then she received $200-$170=$30 in change. The answer is $30."

The correct answer is: #30#
Model answer: #30# extracted from "Let's think step by step On Monday, Rosie runs for 1 hour at 6 miles per hour, so she runs 6*1=6 miles. On Tuesday, Rosie runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours, at 6 miles per hour, so she runs 6*0.5=3 miles. On Wednesday, Rosie runs for 1 hour at 6 miles per hour, so she runs 6*1=6 miles. On Thursday, Rosie runs for 20 minutes, which is 0.33 hours, at 6 miles per hour, so she runs 6*0.33=1.98 miles. So far, Rosie has run a total of 6+3+6+1.98=16.98 miles for the week. To reach her goal of running 20 miles for the week, Rosie needs to run 20-16.98=3.02 more miles. Since Rosie runs at 6 miles per hour, she needs to run for 3.02/6=0.503 hours to reach her goal. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Rosie needs to run for 0.503*60=30.18 minutes on Friday. The answer is 30.18 minutes."

The correct answer is: #150#
Model answer: #150# extracted from "Let's think step by step If Gary borrowed $6,000 and paid it back over 5 years, he would pay $6,000/5 = $1,200 per year. To pay off the loan in 2 years, Gary would have to pay $6,000/2 = $3,000 per year. The difference in the amount Gary would pay per year is $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800. To find out how much more Gary is spending per month, we divide $1,800 by 12 months, which is $150 per month. Therefore, Gary is spending $150 more per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years. The answer is $150."
