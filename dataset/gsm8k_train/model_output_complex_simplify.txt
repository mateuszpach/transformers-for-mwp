He has been saving up his money for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel? Let's think step by step Tobias has been saving for three months, so he has saved 3*$5 = $15 from his allowance. He also mowed 4 lawns, so he earned 4*$15 = $60 from mowing lawns. Let's call the number of driveways he shoveled "d". He earned $7 for each driveway he shoveled, so he earned 7d dollars from shoveling driveways. In total, he earned $15 + $60 + 7d = $75 + 7d. After buying the shoes, he had $15 in change, so he spent $95 - $15 = $80 on the shoes. Therefore, we can write the equation 75 + 7d = 80. Solving for d, we get d = 1. So Tobias shoveled 1 driveway.

Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. What was her previous monthly income? Let's think step by step Let's assume Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was x dollars. 40% of her previous monthly income was spent on rent and utilities, so she spent 0.4x dollars on rent and utilities. After her salary increase, her new monthly income is x+600 dollars. 25% of her new monthly income is spent on rent and utilities, so she spends 0.25(x+600) dollars on rent and utilities. We know that her rent and utilities expenses decreased after her salary increase, so we can set up an equation: 0.4x = 0.25(x+600) Solving for x, we get: 0.4x = 0.25x + 150 0.15x = 150 x = 1000 Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000.

Model answer: #48# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Artemis is making tea for a party of 12 people. Her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. Artemis will use the same ratio for the party. Each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does Artemis need? Let's think step by step Artemis's mom uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup of tea, so the ratio of tea to cups is 1:8. Each person at the party wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, so the ratio of tea to cups is 1:6. To use the same ratio as Artemis's mom, we need to find a common multiple of 8 and 6, which is 24. So for each 24 ounces of tea, we can make 8 cups of tea using Artemis's mom's ratio or 6 cups of tea using the party's ratio. To make 12 cups of tea for the party, we need 12/6 = 2 sets of 6 cups of tea. So we need 2*24 = 48 ounces of tea. The answer is 48."

Model answer: #90# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Elsa has 10 coins for every 45 coins that Amalie has. The total number of coins they have is 440. Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys. What is the number of coins Amalie will remain with? Let's think step by step Let's find the ratio of Elsa's coins to Amalie's coins in terms of a common factor. We can divide both sides of the ratio by 5 to get 2:9. Let's call the number of coins Elsa has 2x and the number of coins Amalie has 9x. The total number of coins they have is 2x + 9x = 11x, which we know is equal to 440. So, x = 40. Therefore, Elsa has 2x40 = 80 coins and Amalie has 9x40 = 360 coins. If Amalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys, she will spend 3/4 * 360 = 270 coins on toys. She will remain with 360 - 270 = 90 coins. The answer is 90."

She keeps three-inch fish in the first tank and two-inch fish in the second tank, following the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If one of the first tank fish eats another, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank? Let's think step by step Since the first tank has 48 gallons of water, Gail can keep 48*1=48 inches of fish in the first tank. Since she keeps three-inch fish in the first tank, she can keep 48/3=16 fish in the first tank. The second tank is half the size of the first tank, so it has 48/2=24 gallons of water. Gail can keep 24*1=24 inches of fish in the second tank. Since she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank, she can keep 24/2=12 fish in the second tank.

Model answer: #34# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information There are clownfish and blowfish in an aquarium. The number of clownfish is equal to the number of blowfish. 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into a display tank. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, but then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank. If the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, how many clownfish are now in the display tank? Let's think step by step Let's call the number of clownfish and blowfish in the aquarium "x". Since there are an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, there are x clownfish and x blowfish in the aquarium. 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so there are x-26 blowfish in the display tank. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so there are also x-26 clownfish in the display tank. A third of the clownfish in the display tank swim back into their own tank, so (1/3)(x-26) clownfish swim back. The total number of fish in the aquarium is x + x-26 + (2/3)(x-26) = 100 (since 2/3 of the clownfish that joined the blowfish in the display tank stayed in the display tank) Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 52 = 100 Solving for x, we get x = 76 So there are 76 clownfish and 76 blowfish in the aquarium. 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so there are 76-26 = 50 blowfish in the display tank. An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so there are also 50 clownfish in the display tank. A third of the clownfish in the display tank swim back into their own tank, so (1/3)(50) = 16.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number) clownfish swim back. Therefore, there are 50-16 = 34 clownfish in the display tank. The answer is 34."

They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take? Let's think step by step Stella and Twinkle work at a rate of 250 blocks per hour per person, so together they can fill 250*2=500 blocks per hour. In four hours, they can fill 500*4=2000 blocks. After four hours, they are joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate, so the total number of people working is 2+6=8 people. Together, they can fill 250*8=2000 blocks per hour. Since they have already filled 2000 blocks in the first four hours, they need to fill 6000-2000=4000 blocks more. At a rate of 2000 blocks per hour, they will need 4000/2000=2 more hours to fill the truck. The total time it took to fill the truck is 4+2=6 hours. The answer is 6."

Model answer: #18# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Joy is winding balls of yarn for her cat to play with. The first ball is half the size of the second ball. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. She used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. How many feet of yarn did she use for the second ball? Let's think step by step Let's call the size of the second ball "x". Since the first ball is half the size of the second ball, the first ball is "x/2". Since the third ball is three times as large as the first ball, the third ball is "3(x/2)" or "1.5x". We know that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball, so we can set up an equation: 27 = k(1.5x), where "k" is a constant that represents the amount of yarn used per unit of size. Simplifying the equation, we get: 18 = kx So, Joy used 18 feet of yarn for the second ball, which is "x" in our equation. The answer is 18."

Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet. What is the size of Benedict's house? Let's think step by step Let's start by using algebra to represent the relationship between the size of Kennedy's house (K) and Benedict's house (B). We know that K = 4B + 600 (since Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house) We also know that K = 10000 (since Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet) So we can substitute K = 10000 into the first equation to get 10000 = 4B + 600 Subtracting 600 from both sides gives us 9400 = 4B Dividing both sides by 4 gives us B = 2350 So Benedict's house is 2350 square feet.

Large animals take 4 sticks of wax and small animals take 2 sticks. She made three times as many small animals as large animals, and she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. Find the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals. Let's think step by step Let's assume that Loraine made x large animals. Since small animals take 2 sticks of wax, and she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, she made 12/2=6 small animals. Since she made three times as many small animals as large animals, she made 3*x small animals. The total number of animals she made is x+3*x=4*x The total number of sticks of wax used for large animals is 4*x*4=16*x The total number of sticks of wax used for small animals is 6*2=12 sticks The total number of sticks of wax used for all the animals is 16*x+12 We know that 12 sticks of wax were used for small animals, so 16*x+12=12+16*x We can see that the 16*x terms cancel out, leaving us with 12 sticks of wax used in total.

Model answer: #37# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information The cleaning company has two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together? Let's think step by step If the first spray kills 50% of germs, then it leaves 50% of germs remaining. If the second spray kills 25% of germs, then it leaves 75% of germs remaining. However, 5% of the germs killed by the second spray are the same as the ones killed by the first spray, so we need to subtract that 5% from the remaining germs after the second spray. To find the total percentage of germs remaining, we need to multiply the remaining percentages of germs after each spray. So, 50% * 75% * (100% - 5%) = 37.5% Therefore, after using both sanitizer sprays together, 37.5% of germs would be left. The answer is 37.5%."

He knows that only 25% of goldfish are at the surface and the rest are too deep below the surface to be able to see. If he counts 15 goldfish, how many goldfish are below the surface? Let's think step by step If Toby counted 15 goldfish, and only 25% of goldfish are at the surface, then he only saw 25% of the total number of goldfish. Let's use x to represent the total number of goldfish in the pond. 25% of x is 0.25x So, 0.25x = 15 Solving for x, we get x = 60 Therefore, the total number of goldfish in the pond is 60. If only 25% of the goldfish are at the surface, then 75% of the goldfish are below the surface. 75% of 60 is 0.75*60 = 45 Therefore, there are 45 goldfish below the surface. The answer is 45."

They're going to run a 20-foot race. How much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie? Let's think step by step For the hare to run 20 feet, it will take 20/10=2 seconds. For the turtle to run 20 feet, it will take 20/1=20 seconds. To finish in a tie, the turtle needs a head start of the time difference between the hare and the turtle, which is 2-20= -18 seconds. Since the turtle cannot have a negative head start, the answer is 0 seconds. The answer is 0."

Model answer: #31# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes. On flat sand, the dune buggy can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour. When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand. And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand. What is Conner's average speed in miles per hour? Let's think step by step If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, then he rides it for 1/3*60=20 miles per hour on average. If he rides it one-third of the time on uphill slopes, then he rides it for 20-18=2 miles per hour on average. If he rides it one-third of the time on downhill slopes, then he rides it for 60+12=72 miles per hour on average. To find his average speed, we need to take the weighted average of these three speeds, where the weights are the fractions of time he spends on each type of terrain. The weighted average is (1/3)*20 + (1/3)*2 + (1/3)*72 = 31.33 miles per hour (rounded to two decimal places). The answer is 31.33 miles per hour."

Model answer: #70# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. In two of the boxes, 5/8 of the crayons were not used. In the other two boxes, 2/3 of the crayons were used. The last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons does Madeline have in total? Let's think step by step In each of the first two boxes, 5/8 of the crayons were not used. This means that 3/8 of the crayons were used in each box. So, in each of the first two boxes, the number of unused crayons is 24 x 5/8 = 15 and the number of used crayons is 24 x 3/8 = 9. The total number of unused crayons in the first two boxes is 15 x 2 = 30 and the total number of used crayons is 9 x 2 = 18. In each of the other two boxes, 2/3 of the crayons were used. This means that 1/3 of the crayons were not used in each box. So, in each of the other two boxes, the number of unused crayons is 24 x 1/3 = 8 and the number of used crayons is 24 - 8 = 16. The total number of unused crayons in the other two boxes is 8 x 2 = 16 and the total number of used crayons is 16 x 2 = 32. The last box was not entirely used, so we don't know how many crayons were used or unused. The total number of unused crayons is 30 + 16 + the number of unused crayons in the last box. We know that Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each, so she has a total of 5 x 24 = 120 crayons. If we subtract the total number of used crayons (18 + 32) from the total number of crayons (120), we get the total number of unused crayons, which is 70. Therefore, the answer is 70."

Model answer: #75# extracted from "Let's simplify the problem statement without skipping any important information Gary bought his first used car for $6,000. He borrowed the money from his dad, who allowed him to pay him back the full amount over 5 years. Gary decided to pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years. How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5? Let's think step by step If Gary borrowed $6,000 and he wants to pay it off in 5 years, he would pay $6,000/5 = $1,200 per year. To pay off the loan in 2 years, Gary would need to pay $6,000/2 = $3,000 per year. The difference in the amount Gary needs to pay per year is $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800. To find out how much more Gary is spending per month, we need to divide $1,800 by the number of months in 2 years, which is 24. So Gary is spending $1,800/24 = $75 more per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5. The answer is $75."
