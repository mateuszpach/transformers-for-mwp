The correct answer is: #121#
Model answer: #121# extracted from "Let's think deductively If the deep-sea monster consumed 847 people over three hundred years, then it consumed an average of 282 people per century. If each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship, then we can assume that the number of people on the ships form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. Let x be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. Then, the number of people on the second ship is 2x, the number of people on the third ship is 4x, and so on. The total number of people consumed by the monster in the first century is x. The total number of people consumed by the monster in the second century is 2x. The total number of people consumed by the monster in the third century is 4x. Therefore, the total number of people consumed by the monster over three centuries is x + 2x + 4x = 7x. If the monster consumed an average of 282 people per century, then 7x = 847, and x = 121. Therefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. The answer is 121."

Model answer: #74# extracted from "Let's think deductively If Madeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each, then she has 120 crayons in total. If 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used, then there are 3/8 of the crayons that were used in each of the 2 boxes. So, there are 3/8 x 24 = 9 crayons used in each of the 2 boxes. Therefore, there are 24 - 9 = 15 unused crayons in each of the 2 boxes. Thus, there are 2 x 15 = 30 unused crayons in the 2 boxes. If only 2/3 of the crayons were used in the 2 other boxes, then there are 1/3 of the crayons that were not used in each of the 2 other boxes. So, there are 1/3 x 24 = 8 unused crayons in each of the 2 other boxes. Therefore, there are 2 x 8 = 16 unused crayons in the 2 other boxes. If the last box was not entirely used, then there are some unused crayons in that box. Let's say there are x unused crayons in the last box. If Madeline has 30 unused crayons in the 2 boxes, 16 unused crayons in the 2 other boxes, and x unused crayons in the last box, then she has a total of 30 + 16 + x unused crayons. If Madeline has 120 crayons in total, then she used 120 - (30 + 16 + x) = 74 - x crayons. The answer is 74 - x unused crayons."

The correct answer is: #96#
Model answer: #32# extracted from "Let's think deductively If there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits in the forest, then there are 150 rodents in total. If each fox catches an average of 4 weasels per week, then the three foxes catch 12 weasels per week. If each fox catches an average of 2 rabbits per week, then the three foxes catch 6 rabbits per week. If the three foxes catch 12 weasels and 6 rabbits per week, then they catch 18 rodents per week. If the three foxes catch 18 rodents per week and they hunt for 3 weeks, then they catch 54 rodents in total. If there are 150 rodents in total and the three foxes catch 54 rodents, then there are 96 rodents left in the forest. If there are 96 rodents left in the forest, then there are 64 weasels and 32 rabbits left. The answer is 64 weasels and 32 rabbits."
